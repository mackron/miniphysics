An experimental dynamics and collision detection library. Nothing interesting here yet, but these are the goals:

  * Single file
  * C89
  * Support for both fixed and floating point math
  * Collision detection independent of dynamics
  * Dynamics simulation
    - Rigid body to begin with, maybe soft body later
